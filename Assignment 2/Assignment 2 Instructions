Building a prediction model on house prices. 
SIGN UP HERE TO PICK CITIES

Business case
 Your business case is to operate a chain of airbnbs. You need a pricing model. 

Part I. Modelling
1. Go to inside airbnb and pick a city. Your core dataset should have at least 10K rows. Go back in time and download listings data for an earlier quarter. (7p)

Carry out data wrangling such as extracting amenities and imputing missing values. 
Think about the process before jumping in and explain your variable selection and feature engineering choices. 
You can use the code of the case study or AI for coding. 
2. Build 5 different predictive models (7p)

   a. OLS  

   b. LASSO  

   c. Random Forest  

   d. Boosting of your choice  

   e. Something else of your choice. Could be another boosting algo, or something else.



3. Compare models in terms of fit and time. (6p)

Create a horserace table. 
Discuss performance. 
4. Take two models (RF and a boosting model) and analyze them. (5p)

Show feature importance. 
Compare the 10 most important features. 
Discuss your findings. 
Part II. Validity
5. Let us have two "live" datasets. (5p)

   A. Download another (later) date.  Repeat data wrangling

   B. Download another city in the same country or region, with at least 3K observations. Repeat data wrangling.

6. Use your 5 core models on the A. Later date and B. Other city data. Compare model performance and discuss the experience. (5p)
