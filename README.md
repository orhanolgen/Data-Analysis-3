# Data-Analysis-3
The Prediction with Machine Learning course covers predictive analytics fundamentals, focusing on business and policy applications with tabular data. Topics include LASSO, regressions, probability prediction, and classification. It explores tree-based models (CART, random forest, gradient boosting) and discusses sample design and external validity.

Background and overall aim
Content. The Prediction with Machine Learning course 3 covers the fundamentals of data analysis with the aim of prediction also called predictive analytics. This course equips students with the knowledge and skills necessary to carry out and evaluate predictions in business and policy environments. We focus on select few applications with tabular data, those that offer good performance and are widely used in industry. This course starts with the fundamentals of predictive analytics and covers topics such as variable selection with LASSO, prediction with regressions, probability prediction and classification with binary targets. We cover in depth one area of machine learning models: tree-based models (CART, random forest and gradient boosting). The course will also discuss model independent issues such as sample design and external validity of the results.

Relevance. In business applications, prediction is an essential part of data analysis. More and more often, prediction is used in policy analysis as well. Machine learning applications have also become prevalent in both industry and policy, understanding how algorithms work is a crucial new skill.

Course prerequisites
Data Analysis 1,2 or Introductory Econometrics. Good coding knowledge is expected in R or Python
Learning outcomes
Key outcomes. By the end of the course, students will be able to
· Carry out reasonably good predictions and evaluate their performance;
· Evaluate the predictive performance of all kinds of models;
· Build machine learning models with some of most widely used methods such as random forest and boosting.
· Discuss and evaluate results of predictive analysis.
· Present the results of predictive analytics and write short reports;
· Evaluate the merits of presentations and reports that carry out predictive analytics.

Learning activities and teaching methods
Format and activities

The course is made up of six lecture + seminar sessions that include both lectures on theory and seminar like discussion of case studies as well. This is an advanced class focusing on predictive analytics. In seminars, there will some look at coding decisions, solutions and packages. Assignments will be essential learning tools, along with working with the code set shared for case studies.

For each topic, there are several optional data exercises and practice questions will help learning.

Coding
The course relies heavily on real life case studies, with data and code shared in R and Python (and partially in Stata). Students are free to use any scripting language for assignments. R and Python are preferred. Stata (+ some Python) may also be used but may need more work. In class, we use R scripts to demonstrate algorithms. Support will be offered in R, Python, and somewhat in Stata.
Good coding knowledge is expected including data wrangling, descriptive statistics and data vizualization, and multivariate regression analysis.


Laptop for seminars with Python (Jupyter notebook or other IDE), R (RStudio or other IDE) installed
